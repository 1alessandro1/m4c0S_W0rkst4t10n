This is a backup to include all the files required to build a virtual machine, full guide here

This is the original backup link for the OSX_10.14.0_Installer.vmdk file:

I'm adding here an additional copy for redundancy, having known that the unlocker provided by https://github.com/DrDonk/unlocker has already been deleted/replaced. 
Here I'll port his latest release (unlocker302_DrDonk.zip) as well as another fork by paolo-projects (https://github.com/paolo-projects/auto-unlocker/releases)

Also, it seems like DrDonk's unlocker works only on VMware Workstation 15.1.0, directly obtained from the official vmware website. I'll provide a link to that too.
