This is a backup to include all the files required to build a virtual machine, full guide here
https://www.aioboot.com/en/macos-vmware-workstation/

This is the original backup link for the OSX_10.14.0_Installer.vmdk file, choose either one or the other:
1) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OChQltE4ejfLIRnyZ1km3KQQGm7tCdq7 (not owned by me)
2) https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eRSHu6QkFu_XCT490t_3S3vMRK3VVg6y 


I'm adding here an additional copy for redundancy, having known that the unlocker provided by https://github.com/DrDonk/unlocker has already been deleted/replaced. 
Here I'll port his latest release (unlocker302.zip) as well as another fork by paolo-projects (https://github.com/paolo-projects/auto-unlocker/releases)

Also, it seems like DrDonk's unlocker works only on VMware Workstation 15.1.0, directly obtained from the official vmware website. I'll provide a link to that too.

Please note that I do NOT own this files, they're here only as a backup. Check out how to create virtual machines for macOS from paolo-projects repository if the guide above and the unlocker302 previously provided fails.
